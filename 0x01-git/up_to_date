The command line is a text interface for your computer. Just like Windows Explorer on Windows or Finder on Mac OSX it lets you navigate through the files and folders of your computer, but it is completely text based. The command line works by typing commands against a prompt, which then gets passed to the operating system of the computer that runs these commands.
